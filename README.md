ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Prediction using LSTM and Streamlit This project is a Stock Price Predictor built with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) and deployed using Streamlit. In the app, users can input a stock symbol (for example, "META"), and the model will fetch the latest stock data, display historical performance, and predict the next day's stock price.  The screenshot shows:  A user-friendly interface where the user enters the stock symbol.  A clean, dark-themed table displaying the latest stock data: Close, High, Low, Open, and Volume.  A historical line chart visualizing the stock's growth over time.  The goal of this project is to provide a simple and interactive way to predict stock prices using deep learning models in real time.
